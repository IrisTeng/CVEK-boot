	abstract = {We propose in this article a powerful testing procedure for detecting a gene effect on a continuous outcome in the presence of possible gene-gene interactions (epistasis) in a gene set, e.g., a genetic pathway or network. Traditional tests for this purpose require a large number of degrees of freedom by testing the main effect and all the corresponding interactions under a parametric assumption, and hence suffer from low power. In this article, we propose a powerful kernel machine based test. Specifically, our test is based on a garrote kernel method and is constructed as a score test. Here, the term garrote refers to an extra nonnegative parameter that is multiplied to the covariate of interest so that our score test can be formulated in terms of this nonnegative parameter. A key feature of the proposed test is that it is flexible and developed for both parametric and nonparametric models within a unified framework, and is more powerful than the standard test by accounting for the correlation among genes and hence often uses a much smaller degrees of freedom. We investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed test. We evaluate its finite sample performance using simulation studies, and apply the method to the Michigan prostate cancer gene expression data.},

	abstract = {Berkeley Electronic Press Selected Works, Spline-based approaches to nonparametric and semiparametric regression, as well as to regression of scalar outcomes on functional predictors, entail choosing a parameter controlling the extent to which roughness of the fitted function is penalized. In this paper we demonstrate that the equations determining two popular methods for smoothing parameter selection, generalized cross-validation and restricted maximum likelihood, share a similar form that allows us to prove several results common to both, and to derive a condition under which they yield identical values. These ideas are illustrated by application of functional principal component regression, a method for regressing scalars on functions, to two chemometric data sets.},

	abstract = {We develop an efficient and effective implementation of the Newton—Raphson (NR) algorithm for estimating the parameters in mixed-effects models for repeated-measures data. We formulate the derivatives for both maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood estimation and propose improvements to the algorithm discussed by Jennrich and Schlüchter (1986) to speed convergence and ensure a positive-definite covariance matrix for the random effects at each iteration. We use matrix decompositions to develop efficient and computationally stable implementations of both the NR algorithm and an EM algorithm (Laird and Ware 1982) for this model. We compare the two methods (EM vs. NR) in terms of computational order and performance on two sample data sets and conclude that in most situations a well-implemented NR algorithm is preferable to the EM algorithm or EM algorithm with Aitken's acceleration. The term repeated measures refers to experimental designs where there are several individuals and several measurements taken on each individual. In the mixed-effects model each individual's vector of responses is modeled as a parametric function, where some of the parameters or “effects” are random variables with a multivariate normal distribution. This model has been successful because it can handle unbalanced data (different designs for different individuals), missing data (observations on all individuals are taken at the same design points, but some individuals have missing data), and jointly dependent random effects. The price for this flexibility is that the parameter estimates may be difficult to compute. We propose some new methods for implementing the EM and NR algorithms and draw conclusions about their performance. We also discuss extensions of the mixed-effects model to incoporate nonindependent conditional error structure and nested-type designs.},

The selection of topics is quite personal and, together with the talks of the other speakers, the lectures represent a story, as I saw it in March 1987, of many of the interesting things that statisticians can do with splines. I told the audience that the priority order for topic selection was, first, obscure work of my own and collaborators, second, other work by myself and students, with important work by other speakers deliberately omitted in the hope that they would mention it themselves. This monograph will more or less follow that outline, so that it is very much slanted toward work I had some hand in, although I will try to mention at least by reference important work by the other speakers and some of the attendees. The other speakers were (in alphabetical order), Dennis Cox, Randy Eubank, Ker-Chau Li, Douglas Nychka, David Scott, Bernard Silverman, Paul Speckman, and James Wendelberger. The work of Finbarr O'Sullivan, who was unable to attend, in extending the developing theory to the non-Gaussian and nonlinear case will also play a central role, as will the work of Florencio Utreras.},

	abstract = {We consider a semiparametric regression model that relates a normal outcome to covariates and a genetic pathway, where the covariate effects are modeled parametrically and the pathway effect of multiple gene expressions is modeled parametrically or nonparametrically using least-squares kernel machines (LSKMs). This unified framework allows a flexible function for the joint effect of multiple genes within a pathway by specifying a kernel function and allows for the possibility that each gene expression effect might be nonlinear and the genes within the same pathway are likely to interact with each other in a complicated way. This semiparametric model also makes it possible to test for the overall genetic pathway effect. We show that the LSKM semiparametric regression can be formulated using a linear mixed model. Estimation and inference hence can proceed within the linear mixed model framework using standard mixed model software. Both the regression coefficients of the covariate effects and the LSKM estimator of the genetic pathway effect can be obtained using the best linear unbiased predictor in the corresponding linear mixed model formulation. The smoothing parameter and the kernel parameter can be estimated as variance components using restricted maximum likelihood. A score test is developed to test for the genetic pathway effect. Model/variable selection within the LSKM framework is discussed. The methods are illustrated using a prostate cancer data set and evaluated using simulations.},

	abstract = {Generalized additive mixed models are proposed for overdispersed and correlated data, which arise frequently in studies involving clustered, hierarchical and spatial designs. This class of models allows flexible functional dependence of an outcome variable on covariates by using nonparametric regression, while accounting for correlation between observations by using random effects. We estimate nonparametric functions by using smoothing splines and jointly estimate smoothing parameters and variance components by using marginal quasi-likelihood. Because numerical integration is often required by maximizing the objective functions, double penalized quasi-likelihood is proposed to make approximate inference. Frequentist and Bayesian inferences are compared. A key feature of the method proposed is that it allows us to make systematic inference on all model components within a unified parametric mixed model framework and can be easily implemented by fitting a working generalized linear mixed model by using existing statistical software. A bias correction procedure is also proposed to improve the performance of double penalized quasi-likelihood for sparse data. We illustrate the method with an application to infectious disease data and we evaluate its performance through simulation.},
